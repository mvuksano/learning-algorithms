# Learning algorithms

This repository contains a set of utility functions that I find useful when learning new algorithms or practicing existing ones.

### Goals

* Provide a set of building blocks to help anyone improve their algorithms skills.

### Non-goals

* Be another leet-code

These functions are not optimized. They are meant to be simple to understand and easy to experiment with.
